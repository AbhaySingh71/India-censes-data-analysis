# 📊 India Census Data Analysis App

Welcome to the India Census Data Analysis App! 🚀 This interactive app is designed to help users explore and visualize key insights from India's census data in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. Built with **Streamlit** and leveraging the powerful **Plotly** library for geo-mapping, this app provides a valuable tool for data enthusiasts, researchers, and especially UPSC aspirants.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Easily explore and analyze data with interactive charts and graphs.
- **Geo-Mapping with Plotly**: Visualize key trends across India by mapping data using latitude and longitude.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Includes insights such as sex ratio, literacy rate, and more.
- **Data Cleaning**: Rigorous data preprocessing to ensure accurate and reliable insights (handling missing values, removing leading spaces, etc.).
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Covers various aspects such as population, education, electricity access, religions, and sex ratio.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To derive meaningful insights from the census data, the following EDA steps were performed:

- **Calculating Key Metrics**: Calculated sex ratio, literacy rate, and other important metrics.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputed missing values to maintain data consistency.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed leading spaces and standardized formats to ensure data quality.
- **Visualizations**: Used Plotly for creating interactive plots to better understand geographic and demographic trends.
